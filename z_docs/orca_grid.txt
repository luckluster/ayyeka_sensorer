Deployment / installation
-------------------------

The grid needs the following:

* Jewish Query 1.10.2 (or later, maybe)
* Currently, the CSS of MetroNIC  (can be changed - depending on the view)
* The following helper of CodeIgniter: form_helper
* The following library of CodeIgniter: language
* The following language functions (usually defined inside general_helper):  
	l($lang_ke);  lang_r2($lang_key, $search_and_replace_array);  my_load_lang($lang_filename)
	 


Files
-----

It is built from several pieces:
 * A library	- application/libraries/orca_grid/orca_grid.php 
 * View	file	- application/views/common/orca_grid-view.php
 * JS file		- assets/orca_grid/ocra_grid.js
 * Lang file    - languages/english/orca_grid_langauge.php  (maybe we should add Hebrew too)
 * CSS file 	- assets/orca_grid/ocra_grid.css (soon to exist?) 
 * This file	- z_docs/orca_grid.txt


Standard parameters which are expected to be passed by $_GET to the grid rendering function
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(In other words, what does Orca_grid::render_grid() can get in the $_get_params field)

Note that all fields are defined as hidden input fields of class "orca_grid_var" inside the grid container DIV.
Also - this is internal information - for use when debugging. Not to be typically used by the programmer using this grid


'grid_name' - the name of the grid - mandatory
'container_datacallback_params' - Parameters sent from the container function,
	in order to be passed to the data callback. 
	see orca_grid::get_grid_container() 
'page' - what page I am at (default 0),
'record_count' - number of records 
'rpp' - records per page - or 'A' if all.
'order_field' - identifier of the field we are ordering by. 
'order_dir' -  our order direction: A or D (default A)
'hide_filters' - 0 or 1. If 1, don't show the filters row, 
	but instead show a TR with the button "Show filters"  (corresponds to the grid param: 'hide_filter_row_by_default') 
'filters' - for maintaining the values of the filters 
	JSON containing an object containing these values (every field is not mandatory)
	[field_name] => object, containing one or several of these filter values
		'value' => ...
		'min' => 
		'max' => ...


Some other notes
----------------

Pagination:  
Pages are represented as 0-based numbers (begining in 0) in the library, 
even that they are shown to the user as 1-based numbers (begining in 1)
so be aware of that. Make sure to convert them back and forth.
